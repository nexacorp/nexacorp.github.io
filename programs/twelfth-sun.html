	<p>Twelfth sun is an API and controller for Draconic Evolution's Reactor. The services/API is featured as
	a rc service. The current services are <code>ts_core</code> and <code>ts_controller</code>. As you might has
	guessed, <code>ts_controller</code> is for automatic reactor control and requires
	<code>ts_core</code> to be enabled. <code>ts_core</code> is a service that triggers events about the
	reactor state, like <code>field_alert</code>, the events are then listened to by the GUI and <code>ts_controller</code>
	(if enabled).</p>
	<p>How to setup:<br/>
	First you need to have a reactor, then on one of the stabilizer, place an adapter and connect it to the computer.<br/>
	Then on your output flux gate (near a stabilizer, if not there create it), add an adapter and connect it to the computer<br/>
	Same for the input flux gate (near an energy injector, if not there create it)</p>
	<p>
	Now boot your computer, install OpenOS, install Twelfth Sun and execute the following commands:
	<pre>
rc ts_core start
rc ts_controller start
	</pre>
	Once booting the controller it will show you a configuration prompt, do everything indicated on screen which is:<br/>
	Shutdown reactor (if running)<br/>
	Set low redstone flux to 100 on input flux gate<br/>
	Set low redstone flux to 200 on output flux gate<br/>
	Press any key<br/>
	Once done, well press any key. Now your reactor just started!<br/>
	The reactor is automatically managed now and correct energy is inputted/outputted.<br/>
	
	And never forget: <s>Have fun!</s> Be carefull!
