	<p>NEXA Operating System is based on Fuchas.
	It includes proprietary tools, including OpenSecurity Utilities,
	the NEXA OS will also not include the Concert nor the Android interfaces from original Fuchas.
	And Fushell will be reworked to have a NEXA design. Same for splash, instdead of ugly loading screens,
	there will be a splash screen with the NEXA Corporation logo.</p>
