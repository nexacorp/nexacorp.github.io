	<p>NEXA Operating System is based on Fuchas.
	It includes proprietary tools, including OpenSecurity Utilities,
	the NEXA OS will also not include the Concert nor the Androoid interfaces from original Fuchas.
	And Fushell will be reworked to inspire NEXA. Same for splash, instdead of ugly loadings,
	there will be a splash screen with the NEXA Corporation logo.</p>
